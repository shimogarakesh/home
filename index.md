## Welcome to my page!

Hi I am Rakesh Tiwari, a plant ecophysiologist based in [School of Geography] (https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/pgr/2033/rakesh-tiwari), University of Leeds. I am currently writing up my PhD thesis on high temperature sensitivity of tropical forest trees. I am interested in studying high temperature limits of photosynthetic process. I studied temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis on trees from the hottest evergreen forest site located in the Southern Amazon as well as on soybean. 

Before I started my PhD I was involved in measuring N2O emissions from smallholder crop systems across four states of Southern India. I was involved in development of N2O and CH4 measurement protocols for emission reduction 

I would like to explore options collaborations in studying temperature sensitivity of tropical crops and sustainable agriculture.
